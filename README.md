## About The Project
This project is one of the exercises that we were provided with via the Bit Academy.
The main goal of this project was to learn about how to create a simple hitscan weapon using raycasts.

The full contents of this exercise are as follows:
 1. The game is played in first person
 2. The player should be able to move through the level and shoot
 3. Every x seconds enemies will spawn in the level and approach the player using a navmesh
 4. The players weapon must be hitscan (using raycast)
 5. The players weapon must have bullet spread
 6. If the player hits the enviroment an impact particle must be visible
 7. The particles must be reusable via Object Pooling
 8. After hitting an enemy multiple times it explodes

The exercise also encouraged us to get creative, though this wasn't necessary to complete the exercise.
Besides doing what was mandatory for this exercise, i also modeled and animated a simple pistol and i made some basic assets to add to the enviroment.
